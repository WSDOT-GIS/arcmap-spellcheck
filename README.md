Spell Check for ArcMap
======================

Requires Microsoft Word to be installed.

The idea for this addin was based on a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code example by Esri: [How to spell check text elements in ArcMap].

This version differs from the original sample on which it was based in the following ways:

* Written in C# instead of VBA.
* Is implemented as an ArcMap addin instead of a VBA macro.
* This version of the tool checks the spelling of all text elements as well as the names of all maps and layers, in the current ArcMap document.
* The original version would only check a single selected text element, and would crash if no text elements were selected.
